# Retake Library

A standalone library, importable and exportable code used in **Retake Studio** resources.

<GithubRepoButton link="https://github.com/Retake-Studio/rtk_lib" />

## Installation

<Steps>

### Download a [release](https://github.com/Retake-Studio/rtk_lib/releases) from the GitHub repository.

### Configuration

Resource configuration uses **convars**:

```cfg
setr rtk_lib:locale en
```

</Steps>

## Usage

To use the library, you need to import it into your resource's ``fxmanifest.lua`` :

```lua
shared_script '@rtk_lib/import.lua'
```

Or if you have multiple shared scripts :

```lua
shared_scripts {
    '@rtk_lib/import.lua',
}
```

## Providers

When you import the library into your script, you don't need to import [**oxmysql**](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql) because it's already included in the library.
We also provide functions for **ESX**, **QB/QBox**, and even your **own framework** (more details to come).
We are also working on provider functions for **inventory** scripts.
